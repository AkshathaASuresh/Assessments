__new__ handles object creation.
That is when we create instance. 
The method __new__ will be called when instance is being created. 
Using this method we can customize the instance creation. 
This the method which will be called first then __init__ will be called to initialize instance when you are creating instance.


__init__ handles object initialization.
This method is called when an object is created from a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class.
